# Theme switcher

Switch between themes using keyboard shortcuts.
You can switch between all installed themes or between themes defined in settings.

## Use case
I switch between 3 or 4 light themes during day and 2 night themes in the night. Depending on the light conditions.

#### Previous theme - CTRL+SHIFT+F11
Finds previous theme in your all installed themes and selects it.

#### Next theme - CTRL+SHIFT+F11
Finds next theme in your all installed themes and selects it.

#### Previous Theme (from separate list in settings) - CTRL+SHIFT+F9

#### Next Theme (from separate list in settings) - CTRL+SHIFT+F10
Finds next theme in your defined list and selects it.
